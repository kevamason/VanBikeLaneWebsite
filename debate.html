				According to the City of Vancouver, there has been a record number of cyclists who use the new bike lanes. From 2013 to 2014 usage increased 21%. In total there has been 5 million bike trips over the Burrard Street Bridge since the opening of the bike lanes 5 years ago. In 2014, Point Grey Road closed down to traffic between Alma and MacDonald. In July 2014 there were 600 trips per weekday on average.

		<div class="col-md-6 details">

				Usage varies due to weather, and Vancouver has 168 days of rain per year on average. Usage rates on Hornby Street remain at 20,000 riders in the winter months, compared to 71,000 users in the summer months. According to Stats Canada, biking in Vancouver only increased 0.9% from 2008 to 2011. Therefore, Vancouver biking in Vancouver is dependant largely on the weather.
				<br><br>
				In summary, to play devil's advocate it is clear that regardless of the numbers, ridership is increasing in the summer months. It is probably not a coincidence that bikes lanes were constructed and ridership is increasing.

				The city of Vancouver has created 10 goals in order to become the greenest city in the world by 2020. One of them is the city's green transportation goal, which promotes walking, use of public transportation, and cycling.
				<br><br>
				The separated bicycle lane program is to help reach the following two targets:
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 50% of the trips are made by foot, bicycle, and public transit
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Average distance driven per resident is to be reduced by 20%

				"In the fall and winter, the lanes are empty. But the mayor and his Vision Vancouver party just wanted to make this the 'greenest' city, whatever it took," - Mr. Szajman, a 57-year-old marketing consultant
				<br><br>
				The cycling project accounts for $2.95 million or approximately $5 per resident. In the future, the construction for the bike path and pedestrian walkway in Stanley Park will cost another $7 million.

				The City of Vancouver states that "If you build it, people will come". There is a benefit to Vancouverites because citizens who would not typically use bikes are now much more comfortable riding in the city. Now there is a whole new group of riders. These riders would not exist without the separated bike lanes that protect bicyclists from motorists. This then encourages people to stop driving, thus reducing the carbon footprint of Vancouverites.  Less parking is needed because of the encouragement towards biking instead of driving. The cost is offset by the environmental gains.

				Bike lanes cost millions to construct, and on top of the direct cost there is the loss of revenue from removing parking. Furthermore, businesses on bike routes have seen a negative impact due to the inconvenience for drivers to reach their shops. Businesses were not consulted by the City, and construction began without a public approval. The parking spots that were removed were not reallocated somewhere else. Overall the streets of downtown Vancouver were not designed for bike traffic, therefore creating a very awkward and inconvenient route for commuters who have no choice other than to drive. A 2011 economic impact study of the Hornby street lane done for the Vancouver Economic Commission estimated that 150 businesses would likely lose more than $2.4 million in the first year of the lanes.
				<br><br>
				So, what are the numbers? Counters were installed in two locations, Science World and Burrard Street Bridge at a cost of $30,000 per counter with annual maintenance of $1,000. The economic study done in 2011, conducted for the City of Vancouver cost $125,000, and was incomplete. Point Grey Road cost $6 million. The cost for Hornby street was estimated to total $3.2 million. $1.1 million for traffic signal changes, $947,000 for new passenger and loading zones, $390,000 for planters and $200,000 for a campaign advertising the lane to the public.
				<br><br>
				Who is paying for the lanes? Motorists have insurance, do bicyclists? Perhaps bicyclists can contribute financially to the construction of lanes to reduce the negative views of being "free riders". On the other hand, some would argue that bicyclists pay taxes and the lanes are beneficial to everyone, even those who do not use them.

				The protected bike lanes offer safety and comfort to cyclists. The safety upgrade includes concrete medians and planters as barriers, green-colored safety fencing, and wider pathways.
				<br><br>
				Separated or protected bike lanes such as cycle tracks along major streets, bike routes with traffic diversion on residential streets, and bike only paths reduce the risk of cycling injuries. It is also safer for pedestrians as the bike lanes keep the cyclists off the sidewalk.

				The bike lanes may have encouraged cyclists to behave badly, which increases the chance of accidents on the road. "They're worse these days because they think the city's on their side." - Mr. Szajman, a 57-year-old marketing consultant.
				<br><br>
				Drivers are resentful towards cyclists because they think that cyclists are "free-riders", who get away from breaking the society's rules. As explained by Stafford on BBC, "Evolution has built into the human mind a hatred of free-riders and cheaters, which activates anger when we confront people acting like this - and it is this anger which prompts altruistic punishment. In this way, the emotion is evolution's way of getting us to overcome our short-term self-interest and encourage collective social life."
